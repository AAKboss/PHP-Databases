# PHP-Databases
This was done just for my assignment for my second year at college. <br>
This was just for php (as in the name).

The order for files would be:
1. Form Page.html
2.VAaidation.php
3.View Tables.php
4.Deletion.php
5.DeleteRecord.php
6.Editing.php
7.EditRecord.php

Ultimately it shouldn't matter lol.
