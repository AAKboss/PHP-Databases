# PHP-Databases
This was done just for my assignment for my second year at college. <br>
This was just for php (as in the name).

The order for files would be:<BR>
1. Form Page.html<BR>
2.VAaidation.php<BR>
3.View Tables.php<BR>
4.Deletion.php<BR>
5.DeleteRecord.php<BR>
6.Editing.php<BR>
7.EditRecord.php<BR>

Ultimately it shouldn't matter lol.
