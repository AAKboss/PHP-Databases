# PHP-Databases
This was done just for my assignment for my second year at college. <br>
This was just for php (as in the name).

The order for files would be:
1. Form Page.html<BR>
2. Validation.php<BR>
3. View Tables.php<BR>
4. Deletion.php<BR>
5. DeleteRecord.php<BR>
6. Editing.php<BR>
7. EditRecord.php<BR>

Ultimately it shouldn't matter lol. 

Since I'm just a student, and not a full developer yet, I'm using a local server (Xammp) so everything should be in it's appropraite folders before running
